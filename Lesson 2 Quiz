1. The following real dataset contains information about two different flowers: Iris setosa and Iris versicolor.

Species	Sepal length	Sepal width	Petal length	Petal width
Iris setosa	4.9	3.0	1.4	0.2
Iris versicolor	5.6	2.5	3.9	1.1
What is the supremum distance between these two objects?

2. The following real dataset contains two samples from the dataset for Prediction of Molecular Bioactivity for Drug Design – Binding to Thrombin, with sampled features. For each activity (F1, F2, …, F10), the class value (0/1) indicates if the activity is active or inactive.

Cases	F1	F2	F3	F4	F5	F6	F7	F8	F9	F10
1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1
2	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1
Assume all the activities are asymmetric binary variables. What is the distance between case 1 and case 2?

3. The following real world dataset contains two samples from Car Evaluation Database, which was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX ( Bohanec, M., & Rajkovic, V. (1990). Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), 145-157.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

CAR	car acceptability
.PRICE	overall price
. . buying	buying price
. . maint	price of the maintenance
. TECH	technical characteristics
. . COMFORT	comfort
. . . doors	number of doors
. . . persons	capacity in terms of persons to carry
. . . lug_boot	the size of luggage boot
. . safety	estimated
The attribute values are as follows:

Attribute	Values (categorical)
buying	v-high, high, med, low
maint	v-high, high, med, low
doors	2, 3, 4, 5 - more
persons	2, 4, more
lug_boot	small, med, big
safety	low, med, high
Case	buying	maint	doors	persons	lug_boot	safety
Car 1	med	v-high	3	more	small	med
Car 2	high	v-high	4	4	big	med
Assume we use simple match to estimate the proximity between objects. What is the distance between Car 1 and Car 2?

5. Given the following two short texts with punctuation removed, calculate the cosine similarity between them based on the bag of words model.

Text1: all grown-ups were once children but only few of them remember it

Text2: all children should be very understanding of grown-ups

Case 1	5.1	3.5
Case 2	4.9	3.0
Case 3	4.7	3.2
